Mod Information
=======

Reworks a couple mechanics regarding the Eye of Ender to make it less frustrating and
more useful, which are as follows:

Eyes of Ender no longer have a random chance to break when thrown.

Eyes of Ender will now point towards the nearest Piglin Bastion in the Nether, and
towards the nearest End City in the End.
